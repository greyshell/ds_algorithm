# TODO

# MST

- implement prims eagar version, understand the benefit over lazy

## chapter: undirected graph

- has_cycle
  - has_euler_cycle
  - has_hamiltonian_cycle
- is_bipartite
- is_planar
- is_isomorphic

## chapter: directed graph
- multiple source shortest path
- precedence scheduling in a DAG
    - 6 is done after 3, represents 3 -> 6

- connected component:
- topological sort:
    - reverse post order dfs
    - directed cycle detection in a directed graph
- strong component
    - find strong components in a digraph
- find shorted path from src to dst in a undirected connected graph
    - return None if no path 
    - if path exists then return the path
