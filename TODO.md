## chapter: undirected graph
- is there a path from src to target vertex
    - find the shortest path -> dual BFS 
- has_cycle
    - has_euler_cycle
    - has_hamiltonian_cycle
- connected_components
    - returns List[List]
    - if one list then all vertices in the graph is connected
- is_bipartite
- is_planar
- is_isomorphic

## chapter: directed graph
- connected component:
- topological sort:
    - reverse post order dfs
    - directed cycle detection in a digraph
- strong component
    - find strong components in a digraph
- find shorted path from src to dst in a undirected connected graph
    - return None if no path 
    - if path exists then return the path
